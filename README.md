## Instructions

First clone repo or pull changes and then do the following:

```
cd backend
```

```
python -m venv venv
```

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

(if you get execution policy error do this)

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
```

(and then try activate again)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After this, To start the FastAPI server and run the model locally, do the following:
```
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
